# Flashcards

See the Full [Project Rubric](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown).

In this project, I wrote a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

In order to build good habits, this project is broken up into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility. As I worked through each iteration, I used TDD to drive out the desired behavior.
